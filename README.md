Folders Currently Under Development
Since this is a public repository, only store folders in the repository that are currently being worked on by you / the team!
After finishing changes, create a pull request for all to get the folder, and after all developers get the latest Master branch, delete the folders out of the Master repository. 
In the future, Create a $7 private repository for full usage of GitHub, etc.
